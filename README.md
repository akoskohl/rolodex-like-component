## Getting Started with Image Placeholder Services

There are several image placeholder services available that allow you to dynamically generate placeholder images for your projects. Here are a few popular ones:

### Lorem Picsum

Lorem Picsum is a service that allows you to dynamically generate placeholder images using specific URLs with parameters such as width, height, and random seed. You can use it by appending the desired parameters to the base URL. For example, to get a random image with a width of 200 and height of 300 pixels, you can use the following URL: [https://robohash.org/3?set=set2](https://robohash.org/3?set=set2).

### Unsplash Source

Unsplash offers an API that allows you to dynamically retrieve high-quality images. While it doesn't generate images based on parameters like the previous services, you can fetch random images or search for specific ones using their API. You can use it by making HTTP requests to their API endpoints. For example, to get a random image, you can use the following URL: [https://source.unsplash.com/random](https://source.unsplash.com/random).

### Robohash

RoboHash is a service that enables users to create unique robot images based on a provided input.
The link is directed to a specific robot image identified by the ID "3" and belonging to the "set2" set of images.
Example: [https://robohash.org/3?set=set2](https://robohash.org/3?set=set2)
